## Circuitry-Based Sound

Circuitry-Based sound is an ongoing seminar at [University of Arts and Design Karlsruhe](https://www.hfg-karlsruhe.de/ "University of Arts and Design Karlsruhe"). 

It focuses on electronic sound synthesis and parametric interfacing. It's examining musical characteristics of electronic sound generators and processors and comparing different approaches on how to design electronic sound modules. Due to the measures against the coronavirus spread in 2020, the seminarâ€™s workflow had been adapted to the restrictions and therefore was hold on-line.

Based on previous's semesters studies of logic chips for sound creation and its musical applications, the course focused on computer aided circuit design and professional PCB manufacturing processes to build custom-made instruments. Participants were guided to use the latest technology, production chain and global logistics to develop, design and produce circuit boards for musical use. This allowed the participants to easily create circuit boards with more variable features and adjustable parameters than hand soldered protoboards or breadboards. During the seminar, several experimenter boards for CMOS logic chips were designed and documented.
