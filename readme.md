# Circuitry-Based Sound

Circuitry-Based sound is an ongoing seminar at University of Arts and Design Karlsruhe (link)

It focuses on analog sound synthesis and parametric interfacing. It's examining musical characteristics of electronic sound generators and processors and comparing different approaches on how to design analog synthesis modules.

## Overview/Introduction

Digital circuit design and remote PCB production for sound modules <p />
Due to the measures against the coronavirus spread, the seminar’s workflow had been adapted to the restrictions and therefore be hold on-line.

Based on previous's semesters studies of logic chips for sound creation and its musical applications, this course focused on computer aided circuit design and professional PCB manufacturing processes to build a customized modular synthesizer.

We used the latest technology, production chain and global logistics to develop, design and produce circuit boards for musical use. This allowed us to easily create circuit boards with more variable features and adjustable parameters than hand soldered protoboards or bredboards.

It’s a multi step process involving only a laptop or PC and internet access:

SPICE simulation software allows us to run virtual tests and probe our signals digitally.
EDA Software offers many tools to simulate circuits and design electronic devices. This software is used to generate Gerber format files which were sent to a manufacturer.
Web browser project management programs helped us with component sourcing and compiling BOMs.

An end semester presentation completed this seminar with a concert performance carried out with the developed sound modules.
